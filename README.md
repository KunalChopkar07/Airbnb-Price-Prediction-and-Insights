# Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

## Overview
Airbnb is a platform connecting property owners with travelers seeking accommodation. Pricing a listing effectively is crucial for maximizing revenue while remaining competitive. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various features, such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics. Alongside prediction, this project provides actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize pricing strategies.

## Problem Statement
The project focuses on:
- Developing a regression model to predict Airbnb listing prices.
- Analyzing factors influencing prices to derive actionable insights.
- Assisting hosts in making data-driven decisions for optimal pricing.
- Supporting Airbnb in refining pricing recommendations to enhance host and guest satisfaction.

## Dataset Information
The project utilizes the `Airbnb_data` dataset, which includes features such as:
- Property type
- Room type
- Location
- Number of reviews
- Amenities
For more details, refer to the [Data Information document](#).

## Deliverables
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** (10 Marks):
   - Analysis of dataset trends, missing values, and outliers.
   - Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformations.

2. **Model Development** (20 Marks):
   - Construction of a regression model for price prediction.

3. **Model Evaluation** (10 Marks):
   - Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

4. **Final Report and Presentation** (10 Marks):
   - A video summarizing the entire project (maximum 5 minutes).

## Success Criteria
- The regression model achieves satisfactory performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²) on test data.
- Key drivers of Airbnb pricing are effectively communicated.
- Predictions for new listings are accurate and actionable.

## Guidelines
- **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract features like neighborhood popularity, number of amenities, and host activity metrics.
- **Model Tuning**: Experiment with various models and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Visualizations**: Use charts to present data trends and model results.
- **Interpretability**: Ensure the model is easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `XGBoost`, etc.
- **Development Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.
